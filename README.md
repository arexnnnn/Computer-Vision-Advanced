# Computer-Vision-Advanced

Hey Folks,

It's good to see you here.
I hope you have thoroughly gone through the basics of Computer Vision as discussed in the previous repository.

In the advanced part we will discuss about-
- Color Spaces
- Color Channel
- Blurring
- BITWISE Operations
- Masking
- Histogram Computation
- Masking
- Edge Detection

Here's a descriptive overview of the same:

1. Color Spaces -
   
Definition: Color spaces are mathematical models used to represent and quantify colors. Each color space has its own unique way of       describing colors based on certain attributes, such as intensity and chromatic information.
Common Color Spaces: RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is widely used in digital displays, HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) separates color             information from brightness, and grayscale represents images in shades of gray.
Applications: Different color spaces are used in various computer vision tasks. For instance, RGB is common in image acquisition, while HSV is often used for color-based object detection and image segmentation.
   
2. Color Channel -
   
Definition: In an RGB image, a color channel refers to one of the three individual color components: Red, Green, and Blue. Each channel represents the intensity of its respective color.
Use Cases: Manipulating and analyzing color channels independently allows for tasks like enhancing specific colors in an image, isolating objects based on color, or creating color filters for creative effects.

3. Blurring -
   
Definition: Blurring, also known as smoothing, is a technique that reduces the high-frequency details or noise in an image by averaging pixel values within a local neighborhood.
Applications: Blurring is essential for noise reduction, image preprocessing, and as a preliminary step in edge detection and object recognition. It helps create smoother and more uniform images.

4. Bitwise Operations -

Definition: Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) manipulate individual bits of binary representations of numbers or images. In computer vision, these operations are often used for creating binary masks and combining binary images.
Applications: Bitwise operations are applied in image masking, region-of-interest selection, and combining binary masks for complex image processing.

5. Masking -
   
Definition: Masking in computer vision involves using a binary image (mask) to selectively apply operations or extract specific regions of interest from another image. It confines the effect of an operation to particular areas.
Use Cases: Masking is crucial for object extraction, background removal, image composition, and focusing image processing on specific regions.

6. Histogram Computation -
   
Definition: A histogram is a graphical representation of the frequency distribution of pixel values in an image. It displays how frequently each intensity level occurs.
Applications: Histogram analysis is fundamental for image enhancement, thresholding, and adjusting image properties like contrast and brightness. It helps in understanding the image's overall intensity distribution.

7. Thresholding -
   
Definition: Thresholding is a technique where pixel values in an image are compared to a threshold value, and based on this comparison, pixels are classified as foreground or background.
Use Cases: Thresholding is used for image segmentation, object detection, and converting grayscale images to binary format, simplifying subsequent processing steps.

8. Edge Detection -
   
Definition: Edge detection is the process of identifying boundaries or transitions between different regions of intensity or color in an image.
Techniques: Common edge detection methods include Sobel, Canny, and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG).
Applications: Edge detection is vital in computer vision for object recognition, shape analysis, and identifying important features or objects in images.
